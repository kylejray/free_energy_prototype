    Freezing the dataclass ensures we don't accidentally modify the data. We need to
    adopt a functional style and treat objects as immutable for jax.

    We don't try to build our own dataclass like decorator (as flax does). We don't
    seem to need all that extra complexity. And using custom dataclass decorators
    confuses the type checkers (which have a bunch of magic to deal with dataclass
    dynamical class creation)
